# Rust Dataset

This repository contains the dataset used in the paper **"Detection of Vulnerabilities in RUST code through Transfer Learning"**.

## Overview

The dataset includes various Rust code samples, both vulnerable and non-vulnerable, used to train and evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) in detecting security vulnerabilities. 

## Structure

The dataset is organized into the following directories:

- `Positive/`: Contains Rust code samples with known vulnerabilities.
- `Negative/`: Contains Rust code samples without known vulnerabilities.

Each file is named according to the CVE identifier and the CWE type.

## Usage

To use this dataset, clone the repository and navigate to the desired directory:
